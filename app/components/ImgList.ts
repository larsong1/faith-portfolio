      'I have always had a love for Shakespeare. He was a master of the English language and his plays have classic themes about human nature and struggle. I wanted to show how this can translate to a modern sphere by using bright neon colors along with modern illustrations. I combined this with a textured, wood block typeface because I wanted it to have some tie to the past and a dramatic impact to show truly how influential these stories were and still are. ',

I did a lot of research on artists like Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson and Led Zeppelin. Their stories are fascinating!

      'The 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle is something I have visited many times throughout my life. It’s a staple of the city and brings people together in an impactful way. I wanted my design to be simple but also seem elegant to show that this theatre is for everyone? I also based it on the geometric star shapes in the ornate ceiling and created a very geometric shape for the logo. By doing so I hoped to pay homage to the rich history of the theatre.',

I created a modular logotype and used it diagonally to demonstrate how they were creating something in music that was familiar but also entirely new and different. ',
